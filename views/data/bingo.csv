B,I,N,G,O
Let's be agile,The slide doesn't pop, Let's send it out as a pre-read,There is a typo in the source, Let's frame the issue differently
But what does that really mean?, This is not MECE,We need to de-word the exec summary,Let's add more depth here,Can we make the taglines more actionable
Let's make a 2x2 ,Don't boil the ocean (but actually do),80/20 rule,I'm not sure if these are the right buckets, Let's have a steerco and advisory board
Some more benchmarks, Let's simplify,These bullets need wordsmithing,Let's caveat these numbers,Tighten up the storyline
Our slides walk, We need buy-in, We need a better framework, These font sizes don't match, The titles are inconsistent
